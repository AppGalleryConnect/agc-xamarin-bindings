App Linking allows you to create cross-platform links that can work as defined regardless of whether your app has been installed by a user. When a user taps the link on an Android or iOS device, the user will be redirected to the specified in-app content. If a user taps the link in a browser, the user will be redirected to the same content of the web version.

This repo provides Xamarin.iOS bindings for AGC App Linking SDK.
